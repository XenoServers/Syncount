## Information
This plugin enables you to sync your player counts across your server network with a single config file! Simply list your servers in the *config.yml* with the corresponding IP and port, and the plugin will take care of everything else for you! You can also use the command `/syncount` to add servers to the config in-game or in the console! You can compare this plugin to the infamous LinkPlayerCount plugin by robske. Syncount has the advantage of being a standalone plugin (unlike LPC) which is much more compact and straight forward should you want to use the plugin's internal API.

Command usage:
`/syncount <add|del> <ip> [port]`

If no port is supplied, the default port (19132) will be used in its place
